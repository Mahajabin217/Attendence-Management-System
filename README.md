#Attendence-Management-System

Overview

The Attendance Management System is a simple C++ application that helps manage student attendance efficiently. This project demonstrates the application of Data Structures and Algorithms, particularly the Binary Search Algorithm, to solve real-world problems.

Features

1.Display a sorted list of students with their attendance status (Present/Absent).

2.Update attendance for specific students efficiently using binary search.

3.User-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

Tech Stack

1.Programming Language: C++

2.Algorithms Used: Binary Search

3.Concepts Applied: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

How It Works

1.Display Records: View the sorted list of students along with their attendance status.

2.Mark Attendance: Update the status of a student by entering their roll number.

3.Exit: Close the application.
